abstract: "We study spectral graph convolutional neural networks (GCNNs), where
  filters are defined as continuous functions of the graph shift operator (GSO)
  through functional calculus. A spectral GCNN is not tailored to one specific
  graph and can be transferred between different graphs. It is hence important
  to study the GCNN transferability: the capacity of the network to have
  approximately the same repercussion on different graphs that represent the
  same phenomenon. Transferability ensures that GCNNs trained on certain graphs
  generalize if the graphs in the test set represent the same phenomena as the
  graphs in the training set. In this paper, we consider a model of
  transferability based on graphon analysis. Graphons are limit objects of
  graphs, and, in the graph paradigm, two graphs represent the same phenomenon
  if both approximate the same graphon. Our main contributions can be summarized
  as follows: 1) we prove that any fixed GCNN with continuous filters is
  transferable under graphs that approximate the same graphon, 2) we prove
  transferability for graphs that approximate unbounded graphon shift operators,
  which are defined in this paper, and, 3) we obtain non-asymptotic
  approximation results, proving linear stability of GCNNs. This extends current
  state-of-the-art results which show asymptotic transferability for polynomial
  filters under graphs that approximate bounded graphons. "
