I'm Sohir Maskey and currently in my third year of PhD studies at LMU Munich, where I am advised by Gitta Kutyniok, in the Mathematical Foundations of Deep Learning chair. I started my program in 2021. My research is funded by the NSF-Simons Research Collaborations on the Mathematical and Scientific Foundations of Deep Learning, also known as MoDL.

I work on geometric deep learning (GDL), and research the mathematics in GDL and its applications. In particular, I work on generalization capabilites of graph neural networks (GNNs). Lately, I have been working on graph neural ODEs and how this framework can be used to overcome limitations of GNNs. Other than that, I am interested in equivariant neural networks, specifally in combinations with GNNs.
