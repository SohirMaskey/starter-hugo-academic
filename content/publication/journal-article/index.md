abstract: Message passing neural networks (MPNN) have seen a steep rise in
  popularity since their introduction as generalizations of convolutional neural
  networks to graph-structured data, and are now considered state-of-the-art
  tools for solving a large variety of graph-focused problems. We study the
  generalization error of MPNNs in graph classification and regression. We
  assume that graphs of different classes are sampled from different random
  graph models. We show that, when training a MPNN on a dataset sampled from
  such a distribution, the generalization gap increases in the complexity of the
  MPNN, and decreases, not only with respect to the number of training samples,
  but also with the average number of nodes in the graphs. This shows how a MPNN
  with high complexity can generalize from a small dataset of graphs, as long as
  the graphs are large. The generalization bound is derived from a uniform
  convergence result, that shows that any MPNN, applied on a graph, approximates
  the MPNN applied on the geometric model that the graph discretizes.
